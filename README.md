*** Code to get info for current inmates in the John E Polk Correctional Facility, SCSO in Central Florida *** 

This project was created so I could deteremine who else was in jail with a friend. They were curious to see what people were in jail for. Unfortunately, they may not know the names of the people in jail with them. This doesn't help with that particular problem, however, it does get currently incarcerated inmates in the jail. All of them.

This project may continue onward. Unsure. As of right now it's only useful for me, so we'll see. I'm always down to make bread tho, but chances are if you're here, you don't need my help to repurpose this code. If I'm wrong, hmu. I do like money.

So far this is just a JavaScript file to pull the information from the website. The JS script iterates through each letter of the alphabet, grabbing all results from the changed page. After iterating through each letter, an element is created with a download URL and automatically downloads the file. 

The python file is to convert the raw info to a usaable format. It mostly removes whitespace and replaces certain characters in the output this is to assist in parsing the data.
